# 🐱 TheCodeCat's GitHub Profile


Hi! I'm TheCodeCat, a developer with 15 years of experience in programming, ranging from desktop applications to libraries, web applications and more.
I specialize in IOT solutions, Industry 4.0, Azure DevOps and .NET.

I'm a proud cat-lover 🐱 and my favorite color is green 💚. 
When I'm not coding away in my studio, you can find me exploring philosophy, psychology, AI, and generative art.

Here on GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects and code snippets that showcase my skills and creativity. 
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

So if you're a fellow tech enthusiast, or just a curious cat 🐈 looking to learn something new, feel free to take a look around and let's connect!
